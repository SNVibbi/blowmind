## Technologies Used

##	React & Next.js
  React is used for building the user interface, with Next.js providing server-side rendering and routing.
	Next.js allows for easy deployment and optimization, ensuring fast page loads and a smooth user experience.
 
## 	Tailwind CSS
	Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application, providing a utility-first approach to design.
	Custom components are styled to ensure consistency and responsiveness across all screen sizes.
 
## 	Firebase
	Firebase Authentication is used for managing user sign-up, login, and authentication states.
	Firestore serves as the database, storing all user data, posts, comments, and other related information.
	Firebase Storage is used for handling image and video uploads, ensuring that media files are securely stored and accessible.
 
## 	TypeScript
	TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
	It helps catch errors early in development and makes the codebase more maintainable.

## 	Vercel
	The application is deployed on Vercel, leveraging its seamless integration with Next.js.
	Vercel provides automated deployment and continuous integration, ensuring that the latest changes are always live.
 
## Development Process

## 	Initial Setup
	The project was initialized with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive UI development.
	Firebase was integrated for authentication and database management.
 
## 	Authentication
	Firebase Authentication was set up to handle user registration, login, and session management.
	Google authentication was added to provide users with an easy and secure login option.
 
## 	Firestore Database Setup
	Firestore was configured to store user data, posts, comments, likes, and bookmarks.
	Firestore rules were implemented to ensure that users can only modify their data, enhancing security.
 
## 	Post Management
	The ability to create, edit, and delete posts was developed, with a rich text editor for content creation.
	Posts can include images and videos, which are uploaded to Firebase Storage.
 
## 	Comments and Reactions
	A commenting system was added to allow users to interact with posts.
	The like functionality was implemented, with real-time updates reflecting user interactions immediately.
 
## 	Responsive Design and Dark Mode
	The platform was made fully responsive using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices.
	A dark mode feature was added, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
 
## 	Deployment
	The application was deployed on Vercel, taking advantage of its serverless functions and global CDN for fast delivery.
	Firebase's Firestore and Storage services were optimized to handle production-level traffic and data.
 
## Firebase Security Rules
	Firestore Rules:
	Rules were implemented to ensure that users can only access and modify their data.
	Only authenticated users can read and write data in the Firestore database.
 
## 	Firebase Storage Rules:
	Users can only read and write files they own, ensuring that uploaded content is secure and private.
 
## Known Issues and Future Improvements
	Real-time Updates:
	Some features may experience delays in real-time updates under heavy load. Future improvements could include optimizing Firestore queries.
 
## 	Error Handling:
	Error handling can be improved to provide more user-friendly feedback in case of failures during data retrieval or updates.
 
##	Performance Optimization:
	Further optimization can be done to improve load times, particularly for media-heavy posts.
